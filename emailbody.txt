                                As part of our continued efforts assisting you and your team with keeping your infrastructure secure, we have created the attached reports, detailing devices enrolled under our monitoring services.  Please use these lists for all tracking or auditing requirements with which you may be maintaining compliance.<br>
				<br>
								The attached lists are as follows:<br>
								<br>
								<u>DeviceStatus</u>: A streamlined list of devices enrolled from this week and last; whether newly detected, still present, or now absent from the current weeks list.  Please refer to the other attached lists for more detailed information.<br>
								<br>
								<u>PersistentDevices</u>: A detailed list of devices which were present for the previous reporting cycle and are still listed.<br>
								<br>
								<u>AbsentDevices</u>: A list of devices which are no longer reporting to the console when compared to the previous reporting cycle.  If you see any devices on this list which should not be present, please contact your engagement lead.<br>
								<br>
								<u>NewDevices</u>: A list of devices which have been enrolled during this reporting cycle.<br>
								<br>
                                Please note:  Our sensors only deregister from the console if uninstalled with an available Internet connection. Sensors which fail to contact the console for 30 days are flagged as inactive and will appear in the AbsentDevices list (most commonly seen with sensors installed on virtual machines).  If you have any questions or concerns, please contact your engagement lead.<br>
								<br>
                                Thank you,<br>
                                Blueteam Managed Services<br>
